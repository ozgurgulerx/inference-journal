# Topics (curated)

Use this area to refactor lessons from `/days` into concise, reusable notes and examples. Every 5–7 days, skim recent logs and promote anything that feels generalizable.

Suggested pattern:
- `overview.md` — mental models, setup notes, and quick wins
- `gotchas.md` — sharp edges and fixes
- Code snippets or minimal scripts alongside the docs when helpful
