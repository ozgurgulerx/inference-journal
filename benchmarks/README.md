# Benchmarks

Use this directory as the single source of truth for cleaned results and plots. Keep raw noisy outputs in `days/` and only promote stable comparisons here.

Suggested contents:
- CSVs with canonical runs (e.g., throughput vs batch size)
- Plots generated from `scripts/plot_benchmarks.py`
- A short `README` entry describing each file
